# Deep-Feedforward-Neural-Network
Design and assess a Deep Feedforward Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras by building custom DNN architectures with stacked Dense layers. The model learns hierarchical feature representations, is trained via back-propagation, and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and loss on validation data.
